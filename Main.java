//        for classes, we use PascalConvention
//        for functions we use camelCaseConvention
//        java is case-sensitive and can store different values in same type of word like value and VALUE are totally different variables.
//        wide space in variable names is not allowed (use camelcase or pascal-case in large words name)
//        don't start name of variable with numbers
